            <p>
                The K-FIST programme aims at developing and strengthening Science and Technology Infrastructure including Laboratory Facilities required by HEIs for enhancing the quality of teaching and for pursuing research activities, particularly in HEIs offering postgraduate courses in the State. The HEI selected under the K-FIST programme will be provided with grants to improve and strengthen infrastructure that would help the institution in achieving higher academic standards both in teaching and research. This programme is for improvement and strengthening of infrastructure facilities in an identified beneficiary Department as a whole, and not solely for carrying out research by any individual Faculty/Researcher.
